I used to work with people a lot. Then used to be
a waiter for 7 years and I also worked on Cunards Queen Elizabeth II ship.

Fun facts:

* I've met around 200.000 people face to face during my time in retail and hospitality
* I used to dream about becoming a football player. Too bad no one told me I gotta do more than  just dream
* I once worked at a startup
