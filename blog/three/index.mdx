I used to write [Counter Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike "Counter Strike") scripts,
then later in my 20s I came across a blog post about a girl who became a self-taught software
engineer. Her inspired me and I started learning to code. It didn't really go well on my own,
so I started thiniking about going for a bootcamp. This finally worked out in London and I
work as a developer ever since.

What I love is that you can just pick up any technology, any stack to a level where you can start build
out anything and deploy it in no time. Or just use something that comes with its own cloud (like GatsbyJS)
and just deploy it there in seconds.

The opportunities are endless in software development, you can work in IoT, engineering, devops, AI,
machine learning, cloud, you name it.

I love it.
